# Chapter 1: "Bets, Not Backlogs"

This chapter introduces the concept of **"Bets, Not Backlogs"** as an alternative approach to managing tasks and ideas. It argues against the traditional backlog system, which tends to accumulate unaddressed tasks and wastes time organizing old ideas. Instead, the chapter advocates for stakeholder meetings before each six-week cycle to select the most promising pitches from the past six weeks. These selected pitches become potential bets for the next cycle, and if a pitch is not chosen, it is discarded without further tracking. The focus is on keeping meetings productive, discussing only a few well-defined options, and avoiding the burden of a never-ending backlog. The chapter also suggests maintaining decentralized lists for tracking various types of requests, bugs, and ideas, with cross-pollination of ideas through one-on-one meetings between departments.

# Chapter 2: "The Betting Table"

This chapter outlines the **"Betting Table"** approach for making decisions about project scheduling within a six-week cycle. It focuses on the benefits of a six-week cycle length, including meaningful project completion and a sense of urgency. The chapter explains the role of a two-week cool-down period after each cycle, during which no scheduled work occurs, allowing teams to rest, meet as needed, and contemplate the next steps. The concept of standardized project teams is introduced, consisting of one designer and two programmers or one designer and one programmer. The "Betting Table" meeting during the cool-down period involves stakeholders like the CEO, CTO, senior programmer, and product strategist, making decisions based on available resources, business priorities, and recent project work. The chapter emphasizes the importance of commitments, introduces the concept of a "circuit breaker" to prevent projects from running indefinitely, and discusses strategies for handling bugs.

# Chapter 3: "Place Your Bets"

This chapter focuses on setting expectations for the six-week cycle based on whether the project involves improving an existing product or building a new one. It introduces different approaches for existing products and new products:

## Existing Products

- Follows the standard Shape Up process, including shaping the work, betting on it, and giving it to a team to build.
- Expects the team to finish and ship some version of the shaped work within the cycle.
- Existing code and design provide context for new features.

## New Products

- Involves distinct phases, such as R&D mode, production mode, and cleanup mode, iterated one cycle at a time.
- R&D mode focuses on early product development, betting on key pieces of the product idea, and learning by building.
- Production mode comes after architectural decisions are settled, with deliberate shaping, multiple teams, and a focus on shipping.
- Cleanup mode addresses missed details, bugs, and improvements before launching.
- Examples of these approaches are provided for better understanding.

The chapter also highlights questions to ask when debating which bets to place, including whether the problem matters, if the appetite for the project is right, if the solution is attractive, whether it's the right time for the project, and whether the right people with the necessary expertise are available. Finally, it mentions the importance of posting a kick-off message after bets are made.
