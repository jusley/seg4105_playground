# Summary: "Bets, Not Backlogs"

This article advocates against maintaining backlogs of tasks and ideas, suggesting an alternative approach called "Bets, Not Backlogs." Backlogs are criticized for accumulating tasks that may never be addressed and for wasting time on reviewing and organizing old ideas. Instead, the proposed approach involves holding stakeholder meetings before each six-week cycle to decide on the most promising pitches from the past six weeks, focusing on a few well-defined options as potential bets.

If a pitch is chosen, it proceeds to the next cycle for implementation, and if not, it is discarded without further tracking. The article emphasizes infrequent and productive meetings with just a few options, avoiding the burdensome backlog. Advocates for pitches that were not selected can track them independently and lobby for them in subsequent cycles.

The article also suggests maintaining decentralized lists for tracking various types of requests, bugs, and ideas, with regular one-on-one meetings between departments to cross-pollinate ideas. This approach spreads responsibility for prioritization and tracking across departments.

The key idea is to keep the conversation fresh, focusing on relevant and timely ideas while allowing important ones to resurface naturally. The article highlights that truly important ideas will re-emerge, while less critical issues may fade away or gain attention when needed.


# Summary: "The Betting Table"

In this chapter, the focus is on making decisions about which projects to schedule using a unique approach called "The Betting Table." The concept revolves around working in six-week cycles, providing a standardized project size for shaping and scheduling, simplifying project planning.

The chapter highlights that two-week cycles are often too short and costly, leading to longer cycles of six weeks. The six-week cycle length allows teams to finish meaningful projects while maintaining a sense of urgency.

A two-week cool-down period follows each cycle, during which there is no scheduled work, allowing teams to take a breather, meet as needed, and contemplate what to do next. Programmers and designers are free to work on various tasks during this period.

The chapter introduces standardized project teams consisting of one designer and two programmers or one designer and one programmer. These teams may work on a single project for the entire cycle or on multiple smaller projects.

"The Betting Table" is a meeting held during cool-down where stakeholders, including the CEO, CTO, senior programmer, and product strategist, decide what to prioritize in the next cycle. This meeting is efficient, and decisions are made based on available resources, business priorities, and recent project work.

The chapter emphasizes the importance of commitments, emphasizing that a bet is a commitment to allocate the entire six-week cycle to a project without interruptions. It introduces the concept of a "circuit breaker" to prevent projects from running indefinitely and to motivate teams to take ownership of their projects.

Handling bugs is discussed, highlighting that not all bugs are urgent and should be fixed immediately. Instead, there are strategies like using cool-down, bringing bugs to the betting table, or dedicating a cycle to a "bug smash."

The chapter emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clean slate with every cycle, only betting one cycle at a time, and keeping options open for future opportunities. Even multi-cycle projects are broken down into specific six-week targets, allowing flexibility and adaptability.

Overall, "The Betting Table" approach provides a structured yet flexible way to make project decisions and prioritize work effectively within the organization.

# Summary: "Place Your Bets"

In this chapter, the focus is on setting expectations for the six-week cycle based on whether the project involves improving an existing product or building a new one. The approach is to bet according to the current stage of the product's development.

## Existing Products

When adding features to an existing product, the standard Shape Up process is followed: shape the work, bet on it, and give it to a team to build. The team is expected to finish and ship some version of the shaped work within the cycle. Existing code and design in the product define a context for new features.

## New Products

Developing new products involves distinct phases, which are iterated one cycle at a time:

### R&D Mode

- In the early stages of a new product, ideas are theoretical, and the technical aspects are unclear.
- Betting is on key pieces of the product idea, with fuzzier shaping and the senior team taking an active role.
- The goal is to learn through building and define the foundational structure of the product.

### Production Mode

- After several R&D cycles, when architectural decisions are settled, production mode begins.
- Shaping becomes deliberate, clear-cut, and specific.
- Multiple teams can contribute, and the focus shifts to shipping.
- Shipped work is defined differently since it's not publicly available yet; flexibility remains.

### Cleanup Mode

- Before launching, a cleanup phase allows addressing missed details, bugs, and improvements.
- There's no shaping; it's a free-for-all.
- No clear team boundaries; everyone helps.
- Work is continuously shipped in small increments, focusing on must-haves.
- Cleanup should not extend beyond two cycles.

## Examples

- The Dot Grid Calendar for an existing product followed the standard process.
- HEY, a new email app, underwent a year of R&D and production mode before shipping.
- Hill Charts feature in Basecamp was initially treated like a production-mode bet for a new product but evolved based on confidence.

## Questions to Ask

When debating which bets to place at the betting table, consider common questions:

- Does the problem matter, and is it more important than other problems?
- Is the appetite right, or should the project be adjusted for a shorter timeframe?
- Is the solution attractive and not giving up valuable real estate?
- Is it the right time for this project given recent work and team morale?
- Are the right people with the necessary expertise and availability available for the project?

## Post the Kick-off Message

After bets are made, a message is posted to inform everyone of the projects and teams for the next cycle.

This chapter outlines how to approach project betting based on the product's development stage, emphasizing adaptability and flexibility in decision-making.
