# Chapter 7: "Bets, Not Backlogs"

In this chapter, I explore the concept of **"Bets, Not Backlogs"** as a refreshing alternative to managing tasks and ideas. It challenges the traditional backlog system that often accumulates unattended tasks and consumes valuable time organizing old ideas. Instead, I propose a more dynamic approach involving stakeholder meetings preceding each six-week cycle. During these meetings, we select the most promising pitches from the past six weeks, which then become potential bets for the upcoming cycle. If a pitch isn't chosen, it's promptly removed without lingering in an ever-growing backlog.

The central idea here is to keep meetings productive by focusing on just a few well-defined options and sidestepping the baggage of an endless backlog. Additionally, I suggest maintaining decentralized lists to track different types of requests, bugs, and ideas. Regular one-on-one meetings between departments can help cross-pollinate ideas and distribute responsibility for prioritization and tracking. This way, we ensure that our discussions remain relevant and timely while allowing important ideas to naturally resurface when needed.

# Chapter 8: "The Betting Table"

This chapter delves into the intriguing concept of the **"Betting Table"**, a unique approach to making decisions about project scheduling within our six-week cycles. I explain why a six-week cycle is ideal, offering both meaningful project completion and a sense of urgency. After each cycle, we observe a two-week cool-down period, during which we refrain from scheduling work. This break allows teams to rest, conduct necessary meetings, and contemplate the next steps. 

I introduce standardized project teams consisting of one designer and two programmers or one designer and one programmer. These teams might work on a single project for an entire cycle or on multiple smaller projects. During the cool-down period, we hold the "Betting Table" meeting, which includes key stakeholders such as the CEO, CTO, senior programmer, and product strategist. In this meeting, we make decisions based on available resources, business priorities, and recent project work.

I stress the importance of commitments and introduce the concept of a "circuit breaker" to prevent projects from running indefinitely. I also discuss strategies for handling bugs and maintaining a clean slate with every cycle, emphasizing that we only bet one cycle at a time, keeping options open for future opportunities. Even multi-cycle projects are broken down into specific six-week targets, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

# Chapter 9: "Place Your Bets"

In this chapter, I dive into the process of setting expectations for our six-week cycles based on whether we are improving an existing product or building a new one.

## Existing Products

- When adding features to an existing product, we follow the standard Shape Up process, which includes shaping the work, betting on it, and assigning a team to build it.
- We expect the team to complete and ship some version of the shaped work by the end of the cycle.
- The existing code and design provide a contextual framework for incorporating new features.

## New Products

- Developing new products involves distinct phases, which we approach one cycle at a time.
- In the R&D mode, we focus on the early stages of product development, betting on key aspects of the product idea while embracing fuzzier shaping.
- Production mode comes into play after settling architectural decisions, with deliberate shaping, multiple teams, and a clear focus on shipping.
- Cleanup mode, which occurs before launching a new product, allows us to address missed details, bugs, and improvements.

Throughout the chapter, I provide practical examples to illustrate these approaches, showcasing how they can be applied in real-world scenarios. I also highlight key questions to consider when deciding which bets to place, such as the significance of the problem, the appetite for the project, the attractiveness of the solution, the timing, and the availability of the right people with the necessary expertise.

Lastly, I emphasize the importance of posting a kick-off message after making bets to keep everyone informed about the projects and teams for the next cycle.
