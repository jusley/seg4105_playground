## Proposed Feature 4: Point/Referral System/Milestones

**Description:**

This proposed feature is designed to boost user engagement and loyalty within the platform by introducing a points system. Users will have the opportunity to accumulate points with each purchase they make. Additionally, they can refer friends to the platform, earning in-store credit as an incentive for referrals. This feature encourages users to spend more on the platform, promotes customer loyalty, and offers the flexibility for users to redeem their accumulated points as in-store credit for future purchases.
