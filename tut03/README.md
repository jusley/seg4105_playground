# notes
- A "pitch" in product development is a directional document that outlines the idea, purpose, and problem to be solved for a new feature or product.
- The pitch is not a detailed specification but a suggestion for how to solve a problem, typically around 800 words.
- Anyone can pitch an idea, but formalized pitches that determine what work to do next are typically written by designated individuals or teams.
- Pitches should not be overly detailed, as the specifics are worked out by the team during implementation.
- Rabbit holes refer to aspects of a project that may seem interesting but can become overly complex and time-consuming without delivering significant value.
- Science projects are entire projects or features with high uncertainty or complexity that require research or experimentation to determine feasibility.
- Spotting rabbit holes and science projects early in the project planning process helps teams make informed decisions.
- Autonomy, mastery, and purpose are key aspects of the product development process.
- Teams often use "tracer bullets" or two-day explorations to assess the complexity and feasibility of certain project aspects.
- The podcast highlights the importance of shaping ideas and pitches in the product development process.

# Rework Podcast Summary: Writing a Pitch in Product Development

In this episode of the Rework podcast by 37signals, co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinermeier Hansson discuss the concept of "writing a pitch" as part of their product development philosophy known as Shape Up. They explain that a pitch is a directional document that outlines the idea for a new feature or product, along with its purpose, feedback from customers, and the problem it aims to solve. It is not a detailed specification but a suggestion for how to solve a problem. The pitch is typically about 800 words and serves as a guide for the team tasked with implementing the idea. They also discuss the importance of identifying and avoiding "rabbit holes" and "science projects" when shaping a pitch, as these can lead to wasted time and resources. The episode highlights the autonomy, mastery, and purpose that come with shaping and pitching ideas for product development.
