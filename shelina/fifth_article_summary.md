## The BrainScaleS-2 Accelerated Neuromorphic System With Hybrid Plasticity

### Discussions and Results:

#### System Architecture:
- The system combines analog and digital computation for a versatile platform for experimentation.
- It's designed for both biology-inspired and machine-learning-inspired learning approaches.
- The system can serve as a scalable unit for large-scale accelerated neuromorphic learning architectures.

#### Analog Core and Design:
- The analog core includes neuron circuitry with a design emphasis on controllability and a wide range of biological parameters.
- The design decisions enable a wide range of tasks and operation modes.

#### Hybrid Plasticity Schemes:
- The system incorporates two loosely coupled embedded processors for hybrid plasticity schemes, emulation of virtual environments, and orchestration of calibration and data transfer.

#### Compiler, C++ Programming, and Library Support:
- The digital architecture is supported by a compiler, the C++ programming language, and library support.
- The scalar processor cores implement a subset of the 32-bit POWER instruction set architecture.
- Abstractions are provided for scheduling and executing plasticity rules.

#### Applications of the BrainScaleS-2 System:
- The system aims for faithful emulation of complex neuron dynamics.
- It addresses issues like temporal noise, fixed-pattern parameter deviations, and divergence from original model equations.
