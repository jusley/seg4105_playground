## Differential Dendritic Integration of Long-Range Inputs in Association Cortex

### Summary:
- Synaptic NMDA receptors produce powerful dendritic supralinearities that expand the computational repertoire of single neurons and their circuits.
- This form of supralinearity may represent a general principle for synaptic integration in thin dendrites.
- Distinct cortical neurons receive diverse classes of input that may require different postsynaptic decoding schemes.
- Sensory, motor, and thalamic inputs preferentially target specific dendritic domains in layer 5b pyramidal neurons of the mouse retrosplenial cortex.
- These dendritic compartments show differential expression of NMDA receptor-mediated supralinearity due to systematic changes in the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor ratio.

### Introduction:
- Dendrites influence input-output transformations, providing single neurons with substantial computational capabilities.
- Active dendritic processing of different spatiotemporal input patterns contributes to both real-time computation and learning-related plasticity in the mammalian brain.
- Different postsynaptic integration mechanisms are organized in dendrites concerning their anatomical input streams.
- Long-range cortical, corticothalamic, and local inputs may be targeted to specific dendritic domains, requiring specific decoding.
- NMDA spikes, nonlinear sigmoidal events produced by synchronous activation of spatially clustered inputs via the NMDA receptor, have been observed in several classes of mammalian central neurons. These nonlinearities are especially expressed in thin branches.

## Discussions and Results:

### Supralinear Integration in Basal Branches:
- Basal branches exhibited a significant increase in measured versus expected uEPSPs after certain inputs.
- This supralinear summation was accompanied by a large calcium signal in the dendritic branch.
- Bath-application of the NMDAR antagonists MK-801 and D-AP5 linearized the gain and reduced the associated branch calcium signal.

### Integration in Tuft Dendrites:
- Tuft dendrites of RS CL5b PCs displayed modest and saturating NMDAR-dependent supralinear integration.
- Measured uEPSPs and local branch OGB-6F calcium signals were recorded for synchronous uncaging in increasing numbers of inputs.
- Population input-output gain was observed in control conditions and in the presence of NMDAR blockers.

### Linear Integration in Oblique Dendrites:
- Oblique dendrites of RS CL5b PCs showed linear integration.
- Expected and measured uEPSPs were calculated, and the results indicated a linear relationship.
