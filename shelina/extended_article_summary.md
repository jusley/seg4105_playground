## Differential Dendritic Integration of Long-Range Inputs in Association Cortex

### Summary:
- Synaptic NMDA receptors produce powerful dendritic supralinearities that expand the computational repertoire of single neurons and their circuits.
- This form of supralinearity may represent a general principle for synaptic integration in thin dendrites.
- Distinct cortical neurons receive diverse classes of input that may require different postsynaptic decoding schemes.
- Sensory, motor, and thalamic inputs preferentially target specific dendritic domains in layer 5b pyramidal neurons of the mouse retrosplenial cortex.
- These dendritic compartments show differential expression of NMDA receptor-mediated supralinearity due to systematic changes in the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor ratio.

### Introduction:
- Dendrites influence input-output transformations, providing single neurons with substantial computational capabilities.
- Active dendritic processing of different spatiotemporal input patterns contributes to both real-time computation and learning-related plasticity in the mammalian brain.
- Different postsynaptic integration mechanisms are organized in dendrites concerning their anatomical input streams.
- Long-range cortical, corticothalamic, and local inputs may be targeted to specific dendritic domains, requiring specific decoding.
- NMDA spikes, nonlinear sigmoidal events produced by synchronous activation of spatially clustered inputs via the NMDA receptor, have been observed in several classes of mammalian central neurons. These nonlinearities are especially expressed in thin branches.
