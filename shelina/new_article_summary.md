## Differential Dendritic Integration of Long-Range Inputs in Association Cortex

### Discussions and Results:

#### Dendritic Action Potentials (DAPs):
- The dendritic membrane potential was measured in drug-free, naturally behaving rats over several days.
- These measurements showed that neuronal dendrites produce many sodium spikes, sometimes up to ten times more than somatic spikes.
- Dendritic activities were recorded over durations ranging from half an hour to four days.
- DAP rates varied consistently, in a sigmoidal fashion, based on the subthreshold dendritic membrane potential.
- The DAP amplitude was consistently smaller than the range of fluctuations of the subthreshold dendritic membrane potential.
- There was a major dissociation between dendritic processing and somatic spiking.
- The disparity between DAP rates and somatic rates increased when animals were ambulating.
- Both somatic spike rates and DAP rates increased when the rats were walking around in a maze.

#### Biophysical Model:
- A biophysical model of an excitatory neuron was introduced.
- The magnitude of LTP (Long-Term Potentiation) was discussed as a function of coincident activation of NMDAR-synapse and postsynaptic somatic spiking.
- The model predicts dendritic location-dependent optimal frequency for inducing NMDAR-dependent plasticity.
