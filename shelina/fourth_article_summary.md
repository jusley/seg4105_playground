## Two Distinct Types of Corticothalamic EPSPs and Their Contribution to Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity

### Discussions and Results:

#### Introduction:
- The study focuses on the properties of two distinct types of corticothalamic EPSPs and their contribution to short-term synaptic plasticity.
- The lateral posterior nucleus (LPN) and its innervation by two different morphological types of cortical terminals are of primary interest.

#### Type I Response:
- Type I EPSPs exhibited a long latency, slow rise time, and a gradual increase in amplitude in response to increases in stimulus intensity.
- These properties are similar to those recorded in thalamic regions innervated by layer VI corticothalamic terminals, such as the LGN, ventrobasal nucleus, and medial geniculate nucleus.
- The majority of corticothalamic terminals in the LPN are RS profiles.
- The morphology of layer VI corticothalamic axons correlates well with the long latency of the type I EPSPs and the graded increases in EPSP amplitude with increased stimulation intensity.

#### Paired-Pulse Enhancement:
- The change in the ratio of the amplitude of the 1st EPSP to the 2nd EPSP (A1/A2) with increasing interstimulus intervals could be fitted to an exponential rising curve.
- At the shortest interstimulus intervals, the latency of the 2nd EPSP was decreased with respect to the latency of the 1st EPSP.
