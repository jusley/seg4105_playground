## Properties and Computational Consequences of Fast Dendritic Spikes during Natural Behavior

### Discussions and Results:

#### Introduction to Dendritic Action Potentials (DAPs):
- Microelectrodes have been used for nearly a century for long-term measurements of extracellular somatic action potentials in freely behaving subjects.
- Most pyramidal neurons receive inhibition predominantly near the soma, which can decouple somatic and dendritic activities.
- Two-photon calcium imaging can be used to study dendrites in vivo, but these can only provide indirect and coarse measures of dendritic activity.
- The study focuses on the effects of synaptic activity on dendritic dynamics and the computational consequences.

#### Synaptic Background Activity:
- Intracellular measurements comparing intact network activity with suppressed activity revealed that synaptic background activity is responsible for depolarization, an increase in conductance relative to rest, and an increase in Vm fluctuations.
- Biophysical models based on such measurements revealed a number of interesting computational properties.

#### DAP Waveform and Rate:
- Depth independence of DAP waveform and rate was observed.
- The figure (Fig.4) seems to illustrate the depth independence of DAP waveform and rate, showing Nissl stained sections of representative parietal cortical tissue from which DAPs were recorded.
