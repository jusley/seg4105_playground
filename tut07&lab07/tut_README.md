# Daily Stand-Up Summary

The **Daily Scrum** is a key event in Scrum that takes place every day of the Sprint for a time box of 15 minutes. This event is intended for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours, directly supporting the progress toward the Sprint Goal.

### Purpose
- Enhance collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum.
- Forecast the work that could be done before the next one.
- Optimize the likelihood of meeting the Sprint Goal.

### Key Questions
During the Daily Scrum, each Development Team member typically answers the following questions:
1. What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

### Focus
- The focus remains on the progress toward the Sprint Goal.
- The structure of the meeting may vary, but the emphasis is always on collaboration and goal orientation.

### Benefits
- Improves communication among team members.
- Eliminates the need for additional meetings.
- Identifies obstacles quickly for removal.
- Promotes quick decision-making.
- Increases the Development Team's level of knowledge.

### Structure
- The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team members conduct the Daily Scrum.
- The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.

### Importance
The Daily Scrum is a critical inspect and adapt meeting that is essential to the Scrum framework's success.



# Chapter 13: Show Progress - Developer's Tasks

As a developer, Chapter 13 of "Shape Up" outlines several tasks to show progress on a project:

- **Update Scopes**: Regularly define and revise the scopes of work as tasks are completed and new ones are discovered.

- **Utilize Hill Charts**: Use hill charts to track the progress of each scope, identifying whether they are in the uphill (problem-solving) or downhill (execution) phase.

- **Communicate Uncertainties**: Clearly communicate the uncertainties and known aspects of each scope instead of providing overconfident estimates.

- **Address and Report Stuck Work**: When progress is hindered by unknowns, use the hill chart to indicate these issues and seek solutions without direct admissions of uncertainty.

- **Refactor Scopes**: Break down broad or complex scopes into smaller, more manageable parts to clarify progress and facilitate tracking.

- **Hands-on Validation**: Validate theoretical approaches with hands-on work, and confirm that significant unknowns have been addressed before moving scopes to the uphill phase.

- **Prioritize Risky Tasks**: Focus on resolving the most uncertain or risky tasks first to avoid late-project surprises and ensure critical issues are addressed early on.

These tasks enable you as a developer to provide a transparent view of the project's status, focusing on problem-solving and risk management.
